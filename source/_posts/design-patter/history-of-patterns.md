# History of patterns
# 模式的历史
Who invented patterns? That’s a good, but not a very accurate, question. Design patterns aren’t obscure, sophisticated concepts—quite the opposite. Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design. When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail. That’s basically how a pattern gets discovered.
谁发明了模式？这是一个很好的问题，但不是很准确。设计模式不是晦涩难懂的复杂概念，恰恰相反。模式是面向对象设计中常见问题的典型解决方案。当一个解决方案在各种项目中一遍又一遍地重复时，最终会有人给它起一个名字并详细描述该解决方案。这基本上就是发现模式的方式。

The concept of patterns was first described by Christopher Alexander in A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. The book describes a “language” for designing the urban environment. The units of this language are patterns. They may describe how high windows should be, how many levels a building should have, how large green areas in a neighborhood are supposed to be, and so on.
模式的概念最早由克里斯托弗·亚历山大（Christopher Alexander）在《模式语言：城镇、建筑、建筑》中描述。该书描述了一种设计城市环境的“语言”。这种语言的单位是模式。它们可能会描述窗户应该有多高，建筑物应该有多少层，社区中的绿地应该有多大，等等。

The idea was picked up by four authors: Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. In 1994, they published Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, in which they applied the concept of design patterns to programming. The book featured 23 patterns solving various problems of object-oriented design and became a best-seller very quickly. Due to its lengthy name, people started to call it “the book by the gang of four” which was soon shortened to simply “the GoF book”.
这个想法被四位作者采纳：Erich Gamma、John Vlissides、Ralph Johnson 和 Richard Helm。1994 年，他们出版了《设计模式：可重用面向对象软件的元素》，其中他们将设计模式的概念应用于编程。该书收录了 23 种模式，解决了面向对象设计的各种问题，并很快成为畅销书。由于名字很长，人们开始称它为“四人团的书”，很快就简称为《The GoF book》。

Since then, dozens of other object-oriented patterns have been discovered. The “pattern approach” became very popular in other programming fields, so lots of other patterns now exist outside of object-oriented design as well.
从那时起，已经发现了许多其他面向对象的模式。“模式方法”在其他编程领域变得非常流行，因此在面向对象设计之外也存在许多其他模式。
